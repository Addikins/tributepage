        <p id="tribute-info"> Equipped with little more than a notebook, binoculars, and her fascination with wildlife,
            Jane Goodall braved a realm of unknowns to give the world a remarkable window into humankindâ€™s closest
            living relatives. Through nearly 60 years of groundbreaking
            work, Dr. Jane Goodall has not only shown us the urgent need to protect chimpanzees from extinction; she has
            also redefined species conservation to include the needs of local people and the environment. Today she
            travels the world, speaking about
            the threats facing chimpanzees and environmental crises, urging each of us to take action on behalf of all
            living things and planet we share.</p>
